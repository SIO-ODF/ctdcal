# Example user configuration file

# To use, call ctdcal.common.load_user_config(<this file>)

# Application Settings
# --------------------
# CTDCAL uses these settings to find and process your data. Change
# them as desired to suit your needs.

# Data Directory: str
#   Path to your data directory. Absolute (UNIX-style) paths
#   are recommended.
datadir: "data"
#datadir: "/Users/ctdcaluser/data/mycruise"

# Manual bottle flags filename (JSON): str
bottleflags_man: bottle_flags_manual.json

# Instrument Specifications
# -------------------------
# CTDCAL uses these parameters when it needs a specification
# specific to your instrument or instrument type. The defaults
# are for a Sea Bird 9/11. Change these if you are using a
# different model CTD. To use CTDCAL with multiple instruments
# of different types, it is recommended to use a different
# configuration file (this file) for each.

# Sample frequency (Hz): int
freq: 24

# Advanced Settings
# -----------------
# These settings are provided for fine-tuning of specific CTDCAL
# features. These should not normally need to change.

# Conductivity threshold (in cast units): int or float
#   Used to determine if the instrument is operating in the water
cond_threshold: 20
# Soak threshold (in pressure units): int or float
#   The deepest depth at which the pre-cast soak may occur
soak_threshold: 20
# Soak rolling average window (seconds): int
soak_win: 20
# Filter window (seconds): int
#   Used by the cast smoothing filter
filter_win: 2
# Filter type: boxcar, hann, triangle
filter_type: hann
# Columns to filter:

# Included for transitional compatibility with legacy configs.
# Any NEW CODE that uses these is not guaranteed to work in the future!
