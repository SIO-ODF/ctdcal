# Application Settings
# --------------------
# CTDCAL uses these settings to find and process your data. Change
# them as desired to suit your needs.

# Data Directory: str
#   Path to your data directory. Absolute (UNIX-style) paths
#   are recommended.
datadir: "data"
#datadir: "/Users/ctdcaluser/data/mycruise"

# Manual bottle flags filename (JSON): str
bottleflags_man: bottle_flags_manual.json

# Instrument Specifications
# -------------------------
# CTDCAL uses these parameters when it needs a specification
# specific to your instrument or instrument type. The defaults
# are for a Sea Bird 9/11. Change these if you are using a
# different model CTD. To use CTDCAL with multiple instruments
# of different types, it is recommended to use a different
# configuration file (this file) for each.

# Sample frequency (Hz): int
freq: 24

# Advanced Settings

# features. These should not normally need to change.
