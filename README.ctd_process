# Configuration File
From the cruise processing directory:

data/ini-files/configuration.ini

Edit the following sections of the configuration file
- [cruise] change all values specific to the cruise
- [ctd_processing]
      ctd_serial: sss
- [ctd_processing]
      TC_side: 1->2 for secondary input
- [inputs] Might need to edit this section depending on the converted file header. This section sets up column call input to data/converted directory.
- [time_series_output] Should not need to edit this section; maintains time series column headers.
- [pressure_series_output] Should not need to edit this section; maintains pressure series column headers.

# Process CTD Data
For preliminary processing run the following command on each raw data file. The file base name should be ssscc.{hex,XMLCON} (s � station, c - cast).

./odf_convert_sbe.py data/raw/ssscc.hex data/raw/ssscc.XMLCON -o data/converted/

# Process Bottle data
For preliminary processing run the following command on each raw data file. The file base name should be ssscc.{hex,XMLCON} (s - station, c - cast).

./odf_process_bottle.py data/converted/ssscc_cnv.csv -o data/bottle/

# Fit Pressure data
./odf_calibrate_ctd.py data/bottle/ctd.py ssscc-ssscc -press

This averages the ondeck pressure reading for the selected group of station casts and outputs the resulting suggested offset to a log file.

./odf_fit_ctd.py data/time/ssscc_time.py -pres

This reads the log file and applies appropriate offset to selected file.

# Fit Temperature data
./odf_calibrate_ctd.py data/bottle/ctd.py ssscc-ssscc -temp

This process reads sbe35 data for selected station casts and compares with ctd bottle data. The residual differences are optimized through a polyfit routine and an optimal set of coefficients are recorded in a log file for each station cast.
need to specify reft_directory in config file and in directory structure for it to work

./odf_fit_ctd.py data/time/ssscc_time.csv -temp

This reads the log file and applies appropriate coefficients to selected file.

# Fit Conductivity data:
./odf_calibrate_ctd.py data/bottle/ctd.py ssscc-ssscc -cond

This process reads bottle salinity data for selected station casts and compares with ctd bottle data. The residual differences are optimized through a polyfit routine and an optimal set of coefficients are recorded in a log file for each station cast.

./odf_fit_ctd.py data/time/ssscc_time.py �cond

This reads the log file and applies appropriate coefficients to selected file.

# Fit Oxygen Data
Dissolved oxygen analytical data files need to be accessible command line and the path defined in the data/ini-files/configuration.ini file. The o2flask file needs to be in the same directory.

Same file base name pattern. '-oxy' flag fits DO data from the path file following the flag.

./odf_fit_ctd.py data/time/ssscc_time.csv -oxy data/oxygen/ssscc
